### Our Assignment

Help us navigate women's stories through their journey with Le Chainon. Design a system to manage intervention plans, a tool that is both engaging and accessible for the residents. The current system is complex and requires assistance from caregivers. We aim to transform it into a user-friendly platform that empowers women in their recovery journey.

#### Current Challenges
- **Complexity:** The existing system, developed by caregivers, is intricate and can be difficult for residents to navigate without assistance.
- **Lack of Specificity:** It is based on generic objectives which may not cater to the individual needs and perceptions of each resident.
- **Organization Issues:** Data is scattered across multiple locations leading to inefficiency and potential loss of critical information.

#### Proposed Features
- **Engaging Interface:** Develop a custom-made intervention plan that places residents at the heart of their recovery.
- **Goal-Oriented Approach:** Focus on recovery related to every health aspect ensuring comprehensive care.
- **Simplified Data Management:** Centralize and standardize data and statistics for easy access and management.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that residents can freely access their plans anytime, enhancing autonomy in their recovery process.

#### Implementation Strategy
1. Collaborate with caregivers and residents to understand specific needs and challenges.
2. Develop a prototype focusing on user experience, ensuring it’s intuitive and easy-to-use.
3. Integrate feedback from initial users to refine the interface and functionalities.
4. Implement data security measures to protect sensitive information while ensuring accessibility.
