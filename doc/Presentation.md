# StepByStep: Empowering Women Through Every Step of Their Journey: Oral Presentation

Hi everyone! My name is Omar I'm here today to talk to you about the result of the collaborative effort of 10 people, 4 sleepless nights way too much cafein and a lot of hair-pulling broken code: what is hopefully Le Chainon's next innovative web platform: StepByStep, a tool to help empower women through every step of their journey.

A lot of us came in this hackathon with little to no experience in big projects like this but hey, with a go-getter attitude and a 25$ uber eats voucher we dug in. *hahaha*. We came up with an innovative user-friendly interface that is very complexe but feels so easy to use. Whether you're a caregiver or a resident, with just a few clicks you can get the information you need when you need it.

Let's dig into said features, shall we? As a Caregiver, you can interactively create and modify plans, you can get global statistics, you can set reminders or schedule meetings or events with various residents and most importantly, you can, at anytime, open a chat with a specifc past or present resident of Le Chainon and check up on them from anywhere in the world.

Now for the real stars of the show, the residents we worked as hard as we could to insure just about anybody no matter the comfort with technology could navigate through this platform swiftly. A Resident can manage their information and contacts, they can consult resources and most importantly they can give feedback on their various experencies with Le Chainon to ensure we're always improving.

While it may be easy for me to just sit here and go on and on about all these features and user-friendly design, don't just take my word for it, the website speaks for itself. Let's Begin the Demo Shall we:
**Begin ScreenShare Here** 
We also implemented a desktop application as a simpler way to open and close the platform.
StepByStep has you land immediatly on the login page we thought it would be best not to overwhelm users with a plethora of nonesensical information (thats for the about page) **Show the about page**.

Now to demonstarte how easily both a caregiver and a resident can navigate through our platform how about we go through the full life cycle of a resident. First step (pun intended): we login through our secure authentification service as a caregiver **Login as a caregiver**, then we create a new resident **Create a new user**, now in a new page, we login as that very resident **Login as the newly created resident**, navigate through our various tools and resources **Display the different resident components** and now lets try to talk to a cargiver **Initiate chat with caregiver**, we hop back on our caregiver dashboard and open the chat with that very user **Go back to caregiver dashboard and click on chat with newly created user**, and as you can see it's as simple as that.

Furthermore, because this is website is called StepByStep after all, as you can see we have eveything a caregiver could ever need from an online portal to help women the best they can, a global statistics component, a calendar to see, create, modify and delete events and various reminders and an audit trail. Eveything is logged and stored impecably and efficently through on our MongoDB database to make sure we never lose any information.

**Close the website** **Back to presentation** Now personally, I think we did one hell of a job considering the limited time frame and limited uber eats budget but my teamates insited we bring up some quick points that we could still improve on, given more time. **Read from canva presentation**.

I'd like to quickly talk about the tech stack we used to accomplish StepByStep: So what we did is leverage Angular for the front-end, NestJS for the dynamic server, MongoDB for data storage and retrieval and Socket.IO for real-time communication all the while following all the proper version control etiquette via git and github as a platform. 

StepByStep isn't just a toolâ€”it's a testament to our commitment to innovation and continuous improvement in Le chainon's mission to support women in difficulty. Together with Le Chainon Foundation, we invite you to join us on this journey towards empowerment, autonomy, and social change.

To make it available for everyone we deployed the website and it is now accessible through this link

***Thank yous*** I would like to thank, on behalf of me and my amazing team, Le Chainon for tasking us with such an honorable challenge, Morgan Stanely for giving us the perfect platform to show what us, young devs can do, and of course, our two mentors William and Denis for being with us through every step of the road (pun intended again), thanks for having me!
